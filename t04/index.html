        <h4>&#60;div&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;div&#62;  tag is an empty container that is used to define 
        a division or a section. It does not affect the content or layout 
        and is used to group HTML elements to be styled with CSS or manipulated 
        with scripts.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;div&#62;Name&#60;div&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <div>Hello</div>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;h1&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;h1&#62; to &#60;h6&#62; elements are used to define six levels of HTML 
        Headings, with &#60;h1&#62; being the highest (or most important) level 
        and &#60;h6&#62; the least important one.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;h1&#62;Text&#60;/h1&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <h1 class="example">Hello</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;main&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;main&#62; is a new block-level element in the HTML5 specification. 
        The tag specifies the dominant content of the document's &#60;body&#62;. 
        The content of the &#60;main&#62; tag must be unique and do not duplicate 
        blocks of the same type that are repeated in other documents, 
        such as the header of a site, header, footer, menu, search, 
        copyright information, etc.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;main&#62;Hello&#60;/main&#62;
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;footer&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;footer&#62; tag defines the footer of a web page 
        or a section. Usually, it contains copyright information, contact details, 
        navigation links, etc.
        You can have several &#60;footer&#62; tags on a web page. For example, you can 
        place a footer inside the &#60;article&#62; tag to store information related to 
        the article (links, footnotes, etc.).
        The tag can contain other HTML elements, except for the &#60;footer&#62; 
        and &#60;header&#62; tags.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;footer&#62;Hello&#60;/footer&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <footer>I'm footer</footer>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;p&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;p&#62;  tag defines a paragraph of text. 
        It is a block-level element and always starts on a new line. 
        Before and after each paragraph, browsers add margin automatically. 
        You can modify the margins using the CSS margin property .
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;p&#62;Hello&#60;/p&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>I'm paragraph</p>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;blockquote&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;blockquote&#62; tag is used to define long 
        quotes inside the document. Browsers usually indent &#60;blockquote&#62; elements.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;blockquote&#62;Hello&#60;/blockquote&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <blockquote>I'm blockquote</blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;pre&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;pre&#62; is used to insert a preformatted text into an HTML document. 
        The spaces and line breaks in the text are preserved. The &#60;pre&#62; tag 
        is usually used to display code, or a text (for example, a poem), where 
        the author himself sets the location of the lines relative to each other. 
        Text in a &#60;pre&#62; element is shown in a fixed-width font.
        The tag content is displayed in the browser in a monospace font.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;pre&#62;Hello&#60;/pre&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <pre>Hello</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;hr&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;hr&#62;  tag is a block-level element 
        transferring all the elements after it to another line. 
        The external look of the horizontal line defined by the 
        tag depends on the type of the browser. More often it is 
        displayed with a border, which creates 3D effect.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;hr/&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <hr>
    </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;dd&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;dd&#62; tag, together with 
        the &#60;dl&#62; and &#60;dt&#62; tags, is used to create a definition list. 
        The &#60;dd&#62; tag contains a description of the term, which is 
        defined by the &#60;dt&#62; tag. There should be at a minimum one 
        &#60;dt&#62; tag followed by at a minimum one &#60;dd&#62; tag for each group. 
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;dd&#62;- hot drink&#60;/dd&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Tea</dt>
            <dd>- hot drink</dd>
            <dt>Juice</dt>
            <dd>- ice drink</dd>
          </dl>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>&#60;a&#62;</h4>
        The &#60;a&#62; tag is used to insert hyperlinks 
        to other pages, or files, locations within the same page, 
        email addresses, or any different URL. You can use both text 
        and image as a hyperlink.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;a href="https://google.com/"&#62;Click me&#60;/a&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <a href="#">I'm link leading nowhere</a>

        <h4>Domain Name System (DNS)</h4>
        <p>The domain name system (DNS) gives us humans an easy way to identify where we want to go on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website, something that's easy for us to remember and type in.</p>
        <h4>Anatomy of a domain name</h4>
        <p>Each domain name is made up of parts:
            third-level-domain.second-level-domain.top-level-domain
            There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many 
            websites use the most common TLDs,".com", ".org", and ".edu".
            The third level domain is also called a subdomain, because it's owned by 
            the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website, 
            like "m.wikipedia.org" (mobile-optimized Wikipedia) or "es.khanacademy.org" 
            (Spanish-language Khan Academy).
        </p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, each domain name maps to an IP address. 
            When we type a URL in the address bar of our browser, the 
            computer has to figure out its IP address.
        </p>
        <p>The computer can't store a database of more than 300 million 
            domain names locally, so it goes through a multi-step process 
            to find out the IP address.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h4>
        <p>Whenever you visit a page on the web, your computer uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
            (HTTP) to download that page from another computer somewhere on the Internet.</p>
        <p> HTTP is a protocol that's built on top of the TCP/IP protocols.
            Each HTTP request is inside an IP packet, and each HTTP response is 
            inside another IP packet--or 
            more typically, multiple packets, since the response data can be quite large.</p>
        <p>There are many other protocols built on top of TCP/IP, 
            like protocols for sending email (SMTP, POP, IMAP) and uploading files (FTP).
            All of these protocols enable us to use the Internet to connect with 
            other computers in useful ways, and to communicate and collaborate 
            across wide distances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="elements">
        <h4>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h4>
        <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, 
            the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website 
            that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. 
            It means all communications between your browser and the website are 
            encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online 
            transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
        <p> To understand why HTTPS protocol, we first should know how wi-fi 
            routers function.Let's say you are at an airport and you are connecting 
            to the wi-fi which is the property of a third party. Now, when you are 
            communicating over HTTP, the text is being transferred by their router. 
            And if I go to a low version of the router, I can comfortably check and 
            read the text that is being transferred. There could be a password that 
            I can use to login to your bank site and do a fraudulent transaction!. 
            Point being - 
            this is fundamentally insecure. This is called the man in the middle attack. 
            And this why do we need https when HTTP seems to suffice.
            Now, to save our data from such attacks, we need to encrypt that data.

        <h4>DNS Records</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>3 types of DNS queries</b> — recursive, iterative, and non-recursive</li>
            <li><b>3 types of DNS servers</b> — DNS Resolver, DNS Root Server and Authoritative Name Server</li>
            <li><b>10 types of common DNS records</b> — including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX and NS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DNS Types: 10 Top DNS Record Types</h3>
        <p>DNS servers create a DNS record to provide important information about 
            a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. The most common DNS record types are:        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</li>
            <li>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.</li>
            <li>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)—can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.            </li>
            <li>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)—specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails to an email server.</li>
            <li>Name Server records (NS Record)—specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com” is delegated to a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of the name server.            </li>
            <li>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)—allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address and receive a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).</li>
            <li>Certificate record (CERT Record)—stores encryption certificates—PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.</li>
            <li>Service Location (SRV Record)—a service location record, like MX but for other communication protocols.</li>
            <li>Text Record (TXT Record)—typically carries machine-readable data such as opportunistic encryption, sender policy framework, DKIM, DMARC, etc.            </li>
            <li>Start of Authority (SOA Record)—this record appears at the beginning of a DNS zone file, and indicates the Authoritative Name Server for the current DNS zone, contact details for the domain administrator, domain serial number, and information on how frequently DNS information for this zone should be refreshed.</li>
